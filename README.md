#nil.lua#

nil.lua is an easy to use, community based, and open source; admin command project for Roblox. Our project is built in collaboration with the popular CMD-X legacy, it is built to serve its own purpose as a community-based alternative.
nil.lua does not battle or bother about competition, we are solely bothering about what our userbase thinks about us, not our competition. We currently offer a feature-rich and well thought out gui packed full of commands that are
utility or informational based, our features will make using nil.lua worthwhile. nil.lua is new on the market (25th December 2021) and is built and maintained by reputable people you can trust and others trust too; 
Zabi (r/report founder), Agent (founder of many community projects), pigeon (CMD-X founder), vr (Ro-Lookup founder).
